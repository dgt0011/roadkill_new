# roadkill_new
.NET Core Roadkill (v3). 

This was a new repository to make the size of the Git repository smaller, and eventually move the main Roadkill repository here. It was a greenfield upgrade of Roadkill to .NET Core.

**While this project is 99% functionally complete, it stopped at .NET 5. It hasn't been continued because of the large amount of work involved with integrating an OAuth 2 solution, and rewriting the front-end as a SPA with React or similar.**

Feel free to fork and roll your own front end!

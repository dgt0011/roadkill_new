These assemblies replace the reference to the NuGet package 'Marten.AspNetIdentity' that provides a Marten DocumentDb implementation of Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.

The original package from https://github.com/roadkillwiki/Marten.AspNetIdentity is out of date with the current release of the Marten package.  A fork has been made and upgraded to use the latest Marten NuGet release.

Fork is located at https://github.com/dgt0011/Marten.AspNetIdentity - the assembly in this directory (and referenced by Roadkill.Core and Roadkill.API) is built from the updated fork.
